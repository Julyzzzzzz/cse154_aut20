      <h1>Welcome to July's page!</h1>
      <p>
        My name is July and I live in Seattle. I  became really interested in programming
        after I took CSE 163 last spring so I want to learn more from CSE 154 on web
        development. My goal is to build a full-stack personal website to display all
        cool things I have accomplished so far.

        ***
        TODO: Finish the following unordered list of your favorite things (you can customize the
        categories if you'd like!).

        Wrap your answer for at least one favorite thing inside of
        an <a> tag, linking to a related page (e.g. a wikipedia page of your favorite animal).
        If you have multiple favorites in a category, try a nested list inside of an li!

      <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
      <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure
      -->
      <article>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            *** TODO: Insert a favorite quote here. Add another paragraph tag if needed! ***
          </p>
          <footer>*** TODO: Insert the source (e.g. author) for the quote here.***</footer>
